## BIRDMAn Output Figures

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks designed to analyze and visualize outputs from Bayesian Inferential Regression for Differential Microbiome Analysis (BIRDMAn). The available visualizations include:

- **Forest plots**: Highlighting the most significant positive and negative microbial associations.
- **Bar plots**: Displaying log ratios of significant microbes across different clinical outcomes.
- **Venn diagrams**: Illustrating the overlap of significant microbes across various outcomes.
- **Heatmaps**: Showing the results of linear regressions between significant microbes and metadata columns.

The example data used in these scripts comes from the U19 Wisconsin Cohort analysis. For more details on BIRDMAn and instructions on how to use it, please refer to the resources below:
